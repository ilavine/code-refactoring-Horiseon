# Homework 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor 

# Project Description

The purpose of this project is to refactor the index.html to make it look more comprehensible, i.e. adding semantic tags, properly organizing syntax, verifying all links are functioning correctly. 


## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](.assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)


## What I have completed to meet the Acceptance Criteria

1. Changed the website title and gave it a descriptive name.

2. Added semantic elements such as header, footer, navbar, section, article, etc.

3. Added comments to describe each section of the HTML code.

4. Configure the CSS file since some elements names have been changed.

5. Created a GitHub repository and uploaded my project on GitHub using the GitBash Terminal.

6. Created a GitHub Page.
